_Every year or so, I hope to define (and re-define) "socialism". This exercise primarily benefits me: To put my thoughts into words and see how they change over time. The 2020 definition follows._

Socialism is economic democracy. I explain what that means and in the first "Socialism Done Short" video.

### Section 0: Introduction
Today for Socialism Done Short I hope to explain socialism itself. The problem is that any socialist worth their salt knows that socialists sharply disagree on what socialism means and how we should get there. That's why I say that socialism is not one singular idea but a school of ideas. Put another way, there is no one socialism, singular, but there are many socialisms, plural. However, I believe that every socialist ideology shares four basic principles:

Quadruplet A:
1. Class abolition
2. Participatory government
3. Worker self-management
4. Social ownership

The goal of these principles is to establish economic democracy, where everyone has roughly equal power in and control over the economy. This is very different than capitalism, where the very wealthy control most of Therefore, to emphasize the democratic goals of socialism, I also summarize these principles as

Quadruplet B:
1. Flattened inequality
2. Political democracy
3. Workplace democracy
4. Macroeconomic democracy

Each section of this video will explain one principle. Let's get started.

### Section 1: Class abolition and flattened inequality
Ownership is power, because power is the ability to make other people conform with your desires, and ownership gives you exclusive control over something. When you alone own a business, you control what happens inside that organization. When you alone own land, you can choose to exclude people from your property.

Wealth *is* power. When someone else owns your firm, they control your life. When someone else profits from your labor, they take resources you need to survive and thrive. Socialist equality means two things:

First, universal basic needs: Regardless of their success, everybody's basic needs should be met, meaning housing, healthcare, clothing, food, basic education, etc.

Second, equality of opportunity: Regardless of their identity, everybody should succeed or fail and be compensated on their own merit, not because of inheritance, poverty, race, sex, etc.

### Section 2: Worker self-management and workplace democracy
Worker ownership means two things:

First, workplace democracy: Under socialism, the workers of each firm collectively own its assets and democratically choose its policies and its leaders, like cooperative firms today. This ensures that workplace hierarchies are based on consensus, not imposed from above. Workplace democracy promotes better working conditions and long-term production. 

Second, collective ownership of capital: under socialism, all the workers of society collectively own all the capital of society. This eliminates the owner class and vastly raises most people's incomes. Collective ownership also ensures that society can seize harmful or unproductive capital, such as high-pollution industries or empty factory buildings, and repurpose them.

### Section 3: Social ownership and macroeconomic democracy
Democratic planning means that the people decide which goods and services to produce and how to distribute them instead of letting profit motives decide. These democratic decisions are implemented by economic planners, who are commune leaders under council communism, union leaders under syndicalism, or central planners under more federalist or unitarist socialisms. Democratic planning has several benefits:

First, participatory economics: Under capitalism, you vote with your wallet. But you get less votes if you're poor, you often have to choose between two flawed products, and if you need a good to live then you have no choice at all. Democratic discussion gives everyone equal weight in a truly open choice.

Second, social benefit and social cost, or positive and negative externalities: Planning allows society to provide products that don't sell well but help society at a fiscal loss for social benefit, such as free housing or long-term fusion research. It also allows society to avoid products that sell well but harm society, such as cigarettes or addictive video games.

Third, constant growth: Planning replaces the recessions and expansions of markets with steady growth by mathematically balancing inputs and outputs across industries.

### Section 4: Participatory government and political democracy
A spectrum exists between political democracy and political oligarchy. On the one end, democracies ensure that the people as a whole share all political power and therefore control all government policies. On the other end, oligarchies like monarchies or military juntas ensure that only a small group of people have all the real political power. Democracy shares power widely and equally while oligarchy takes power from the many to concentrate among the few.

Political scientists label most modern countries as "liberal" or "bourgeois democracies" and most of you viewers are watching from liberal democracies. Lib democracies are partly democratic, because they allow people to control government policy indirectly through elections and sometimes even directly through referenda. But lib democracies are also partly oligarchic for four reasons:

First, as explained in the first section, highly unequal ownership means highly unequal political power. Therefore, socialism and economic democracy require class abolition.

Second, as explained in the second section, people's work lives are mostly spent in undemocratic workplaces. Therefore, socialism and economic democracy require worker self-management.

Third, as explained in the third section, macroeconomic market forces systematically shift production away from where it would be set by democracy. Therefore, socialism and economic democracy require social ownership.

And fourth, even if we achieved class abolition and worker self-management and social ownership, the structures of liberal democracy discourage most people from meaningfully participating in government. There are way, way too many undemocratic structures and proposed solutions to discuss here, so I'll cover them in future videos. 

### Conclusion
In short, socialists envision a radically more democratic society. Socialism means economic democracy means class abolition, worker self-management, social ownership, and participatory politics. Socialists want more people to share more political power and own more economic power. If you support economic democracy, then you should become a socialist.
