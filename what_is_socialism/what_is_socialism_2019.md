_Every year or so, I hope to define (and re-define) "socialism". This exercise primarily benefits me: To put my thoughts into words and see how they change over time. The 2019 definition follows._

Socialism has many sub-ideologies, but every socialist ideology supports three things:

1. Worker-owned workplaces
2. Democratically-planned production
3. Low-inequality society

### 1: Worker ownership

Worker ownership means two things:

First, workplace democracy: Under socialism, the workers of each firm collectively own its assets and democratically choose its policies and its leaders, like cooperative firms today. This ensures that workplace hierarchies are based on consensus, not imposed from above. Workplace democracy promotes better working conditions and long-term production. 

Second, collective ownership of capital: under socialism, all the workers of society collectively own all the capital of society. This eliminates the owner class and vastly raises most people's incomes. Collective ownership also ensures that society can seize harmful or unproductive capital, such as high-pollution industries or empty factory buildings, and repurpose them.

### 2: Democratic planning

Democratic planning means that the people decide which goods and services to produce and how to distribute them, instead of letting profit motives decide. These democratic decisions are implemented by economic planners, who are commune leaders under council communism, union leaders under syndicalism, or central planners under more federalist or unitarist socialisms. Democratic planning has several benefits:

First, participatory economics: Under capitalism, you vote with your wallet. But you get less votes if you're poor, you often have to choose between two flawed products, and if you need a good to live then you have no choice at all. Democratic discussion gives everyone equal weight in a truly open choice.

Second, social benefit and social cost, or positive and negative externalities: Planning allows society to provide products that don't sell well but help society at a fiscal loss for social benefit, such as free housing or long-term fusion research. It also allows society to avoid products that sell well but harm society, such as cigarettes or addictive video games.

Third, constant growth: Planning replaces the recessions and expansions of markets with steady growth by mathematically balancing inputs and outputs across industries. This increases long-term growth.

### 3: Low inequality

Wealth *is* power. When someone else owns your firm, they control your life. When someone else profits from your labor, they take resources you need to survive and thrive. Socialist equality means two things:

First, universal basic needs: Regardless of their success, everybody's basic needs should be met, meaning housing, healthcare, clothing, food, basic education, etc.

Second, equality of opportunity: Regardless of their identity, everybody should succeed or fail and be compensated on their own merit, not because of inheritance, poverty, race, sex, etc.

### Conclusion

Socialism advocates for worker ownership, democratic planning, and low inequality.
