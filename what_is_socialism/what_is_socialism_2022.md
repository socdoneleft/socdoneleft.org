_Every year or so, I hope to define (and re-define) "socialism". This exercise primarily benefits me: To put my thoughts into words and see how they change over time. The 2022 definition follows._

DSA cofounder and literary critic Irving Howe once wrote that "socialism is the name of our desire". Socialism is a vision of the future that "provides moral sustenance" and "gives urgency to" our "criticism of the human condition".[^howe1954] Howe later wrote that there is "utopia" -- imposed by an elite through terror -- and there is utopia:

"But whether a real option or a mere fantasy, this utopia is as needed by mankind as bread and shelter."[^howe1982]

Socialism is not one idea: There is no singular "socialism". Socialism is a collection of ideas: There are many "socialisms". There is no "true" or "false" socialism, no "authentic" or "revisionist" socialism.

If socialism means anything, it means greater equality of power.

If socialism means anything, it means political democracy and economic democracy: The extension of democracy deeper into politics and also into economics. Power should be shared more equally, among more people More power, to more people, in more ways. Economic democracy demands greater equality in ownership, control of production, and control of politics. 

### What unites the many socialisms?

To that end, all socialisms share three goals:

1. **Class abolition:** Capitalist societies are divided into two classes: **Workers**, who need to work in order to fulfill their human basics. **Owners**, who do not need to work, because they benefit from privately controlling the capital at which workers must work. Socialisms seek to ensure that everyone receives their human basics and ensure that everybody benefits from capital.
    * **Worker-class abolition:** This requires **labor decommodification**, which means that every person should be able to maintain their human basics without selling their labor. In turn, that requires every person to have **human basics provided independent of income** (think Universal Basic Needs) and/or **income independent of labor** (think Universal Basic Income).
    * **Owner-class abolition:** This requires **capital socialization**, which means that all privately-owned capital would become socially owned. Social ownership can takes many forms. See "investment socialization" and "workplace democracy".
2. **Production for use:** Capitalist societies encourage firms to **produce for profit**: to maximize profit.[^pkenote] Socialisms seek to build societies that **produce for use**: to maximize fulfillment of human basics & desires. Because profit ultimately results from fulfilling human basics & desires (whether of persons or of governments), production for profit may overlap with production for use. However, socialists believe that profit is fundamentally misaligned with use.
    * **Production socialization:** Personal consumption under capitalism is undemocratic: Profit is per dollar, not per person, and some people have many more dollars. Unions. Labor decommodification.
    * **Investment socialization:** Social banks, social wealth funds, co-op banks.
3. **Radical democracy**: Modern liberal democracies provide people substantially more freedom and political control than non-democracies or bourgeois democracies. Socialists wish to deepen democracy and extend democracy to workplaces. **Free association**
    * **Participatory democracy:** Socialists wish to see greater control of politics 
    * **Workplace democracy:** codetermination, public firms, labor-managed firms, co-ops

### What divides the many socialisms?

Socialisms differ dramatically in how they seek to achieve these goals.

[^pkenote]: In neoclassical models, firms straightforwardly maximize profit, or get outcompeted. In Post-Keynesian models, firms pursue growth, which occurs more extensiveley/frequently when they pursue profit. In both model types, successful firms must pursue profit.
[^marksocnote]: Marxist definitions of "production for use" often focus on "direct production for use" under "cooperative production": Some direct link between human basics-desires and production. Market socialists have long critiqued this vision as impossible.
