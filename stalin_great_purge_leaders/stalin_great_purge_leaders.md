# Stalin killed 3/5 of the original Soviet leadership

People who are ignorant (or willfully ignorant) of Soviet history sometimes defend or deny Stalinist authoritarianism.

For example, see this exchange on Twitter:

![A: "THE CRIMES OF STALIN (thread) 1. Bank robbery (1907)
Thanks for reading!" B: [meme] "The victims of communism... Are just Nazis and landlords?"](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/987914822735786014/unknown.png)

This is a play on Stalin defender and [crank](https://twitter.com/SocDoneLeft/status/1520083406759116800) Grover Furr, who claimed that he is ["yet to find one crime that Stalin committed"](https://archive.org/details/grover-furr-says-he-is-yet-to-find-one-crime-that-stalin-committed).

This post will highlight one set of victims that most Stalin defenders will not consider "Nazis and landlords": The original leaders of the Bolsheviks and the Soviet Union.

### The original leaders of the Soviet Union

In August 1917, the 6th Congress of the Bolsheviks[^tsk] appointed its [Central Committee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Committee_of_the_6th_Congress_of_the_Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party_(Bolsheviks)) (TsK, from Центра́льный комите́т), which de-facto controlled the Bolsheviks. This TsK launched the Bolsheviks from a faction of the Social-Democratic Labor Party to toppling the government and seizing power.[^russiancivilwar] It was pretty damn important!

In November 1917, the 2nd Congress of Soviets[^snk] appointed the first [Council of People's Commissars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_People%27s_Commissars) (SNK, from Сове́т наро́дных комисса́ров), which de-facto controlled the new Soviet Union. It was also pretty damn important!

The choices these 30 people made forever shaped the new Soviet Union. They were committed communists -- committed enough to start and win a brutal 5-year civil war.

In less than 5 years, Stalin's security services killed 18 of them:[^code]

![Between 1938 and 1940, Stalin killed 18 of 30 people who had created the Soviet Union](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/987938577084203028/stalin_great_purge_leaders.png)

Including Stalin, just 3 of 30 foundational Bolsheviks survived the Great Purge: Stalin's security services killed 18 of the original 30 Soviet leaders -- that's 60% of the total and 86% of the 21 original Soviet leaders still alive. Stalin nearly *[decimated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimation_(punishment))* the original Soviet leadership.

Stalin killed these committed communist leaders not because they were evil, but in a successful bid to further secure his power.

### Conclusions

Soviet history makes clear that Stalinist authoritarianism was both brutal and counterproductive: A vast cost of human lives for [no gain at all](https://twitter.com/SocDoneLeft/status/1520089140846641153).

Socialists must worshipping Stalin. Fawning after dead authoritarians won't build a socialist movement.

[^russiancivilwar]: A very brief history of the early Soviet Union: In March 1917, the [February Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/February_Revolution) toppled the [monarchy of Russia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsarist_autocracy) and installed an interim [Provisional Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Provisional_Government) in Petrograd, pending [elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1917_Russian_Constituent_Assembly_election). This government deeply dissatisfied the [Bolshevik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bolsheviks) section of the [RSDLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Social_Democratic_Labour_Party). In September 1917, [a rightist military coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kornilov_affair) was defeated bloodlessly by the [Petrograd Soviet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petrograd_Soviet). In November 1917, armed Bolshevik [Red Guards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Guards_(Russia)) begin the [October Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Revolution#October_Revolution) and seized power from the Provisional Government for the Petrograd Soviet. Thus began the [Russian Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Civil_War).
