Transgender Regret and Detransition are Rare

music: Dyalla "Good Time", Beats to Go Viral to Vol 2

---

Detransition and regret are both real and should be respected. But both are rare and neither is a strong argument for restricting gender-affirming healthcare.

## Overview

Rightist media has recently highlighted several stories of people who have detransitioned or who regret their medical transition.[^carlson2022][^knowles2022][^white2022] Rightists often argue that these stories are common -- and common enough that the state should restrict access to gender-affirming healthcare.

We should always be empathetic to everyone exploring their gender. Transition and detranstion are both difficult, emotional processes. People deserve space to find the best version of themselves.

But we cannot let stories decide policy, especially when those policies restrict the medical and gender freedoms of other people. Multiple lines of evidence show that detransition and regret are rare while positive outcomes are common.

## Strongest studies on detransition and regret

There are hundreds of studies on transgender healthcare and dozens on detransition and regret. For concision, this blogpost will focus on the four strongest studies:

* A large longitudinal study of transgender patients in the Netherlands, Wiepjes et al 2018[^wiepjes2018]
* A large cross-sectional study of trans people in the USA, Turban et al 2021[^turban2021]
* A large meta-analysis of multiple studies of gender-affirming surgery patients, Bustos et al 2021[^bustos2021]

Each study has different strengths and weaknesses. Taken together, they provide multiple reasons to believe that rates of detransition and regret are low.

Each section will be a bit dry: I will recontextualize each at the end of each section.

## The Dutch Study: Wiepjes et al 2018

### Data source

The [VU University Medical Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_University_Medical_Center) (VUmc) [Center of Expertise on Gender Dysphoria](https://www.vumc.com/departments/center-of-expertise-on-gender-dysphoria.htm) (CEGD) treats ~95% of transgender patients in the Netherlands.[^wiepjes2018note1] This is a major strength of the Wiepjes et al 2018 evidence, as the sample of hospital registries includes nearly the entire Dutch transgender population that sought medical transition -- so results are unlikely to be driven by selection-related biases.

The CEGD pioneered an approach to transgender care known as the "Dutch Model". The published 2014 version of the Dutch Model emphasizes "watchful waiting", which only treats patients with gender dysphoria (GD), discourages social or medical transition for children under ~12), encourages puberty suppressants (PS) at ~12, gender-affirming hormones (GAH) at ~16, and gender-affirming surgery (GAS) after 18 and >1.5 years of GAH.[^schumer2015][^devries2012] This approach was once considered radical, but is now mainstream in European gender identity clinics.

The CEGD reviewed all of its medical records of all patients from 1972 to 2015. This is a major strength *and* limitation of the Wiepjes et al 2018 evidence: Unlike patient recall on surveys, medical records are more likely to record when and what treatments a patient actually received. However, medical records cannot include symptoms that a patient did not report (or that medical staff did not record). For example, if a patient regretted a surgery, but never reported that to medical staff, it would not be on their medical report.

### Results

**In short: 0.5% of gender-affirming surgery (GAS) patients reported regret to the CEGD.**

From 1972 to 2015, 2760 trans women and 985 trans men visited the VUcm CEGD. Of those, 2624 trans women (68.9%) and 1183 trans men (72.9%) began gender-affirming hormones (GAH). Of those, 1976 trans women (79.5%) and 992 trans men (83.8%) obtained gender-affirming surgery (GAS); and of those, 11 trans women (0.6%) and 3 trans men (0.3%) reported regret to the CEGD.

Of the 14 GAS patients who reported regret: 5 (35%) reported problems with social acceptance; 2 (14%) reported that they felt non-binary; and 7 (50%) reported "true regret".

![Characteristics of GAS patients with regret](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/987602689540112434/unknown.png)

The average regretful GAS patient took ~8 years to report regret to the CEGD and the median patient took ~6 years. The very long time period (nearly 20 years) and the fact that this distribution is left-skewed suggests against a large group of regretful patients "in the wings", waiting to report their regret.

### Generalizability

It is plausible that Dutch Model sample may not be generalized to American clinics, some of which do not follow the Dutch Model.[^chen2020] These American clinics follow a less-restrictive model, which does not discourage children from social transition, provides PS at [Tanner Stage 2](https://www.healthline.com/health/parenting/stages-of-puberty) (around ~9yo, against the Dutch Model's ~12yo), and requires a smaller number of diagnostic visits before PS or GAH.

Because these methodologies are different, and because American transgender patients have different demographics (such as: less social acceptance, less European ancestry), the evidence from Dutch patients may not directly apply to American patients. This is a major limit of the Wiepjes et al 2018 evidence.

However, in one very important aspect, the Dutch and American samples are more analogous. A set of evidence from the CEGD shows that, despite a massive increase in patients, there was no decline in proportion of patients needing gender-affirming care.

Between 2000 and 2016, the CEGD saw a dramatic, nearly 10x increase in adolescent patients referred to the clinic:[^arnoldussen2018note0]

![20 patients in 2001, 230 patients in 2016](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/987469136747696178/unknown.png)

This might cause alarm: Perhaps this flood of patients is driven by peer pressure and [Rapid Onset Gender Dysphoria](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BZvAeOwAvU) to pursue medical transition. Perhaps these patients have other mental problems which they are merely interpreting as gender dysphoria (GD).

The evidence strongly rejects both claims. Among patients who attended the CEGD, a near-constant proportion have been diagnosed with GD:[^arnoldussen2018note1]

![Among patients referred to the CEGD, a constant proportion were diagnosed with gender dysphoria (trend was not significant)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/987468202999185468/unknown.png)

And the patients attending the CEGD have actually reported slightly *better* mental states:[^arnoldussen2018note2]

![Among patients referred to the CEGD, mental states slightly improved (β=-0.396, p<0.001)](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/987770801346449418/unknown.png)

Among GD patients, a near-constant proportion of patients have received gender-affirming hormones (GAH); and among GAH patients, a near-constant proportion have received gender-affirming surgery (GAS):[^wiepjes2018note2]

![Since 2000, a near-constant rate of GD patients receive GAH, and a near-constant rate of GAH patients receive GAS](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/987612302855516200/unknown.png)

Arnoldussen et al 2018 conclude their paper by observing that gender dysphoria was likely more common among Dutch people than expected and that gender-affirming treatment would likely benefit these new patients:

> Our study assured that **adolescents referred to a long existing specialized transgender service did not show critical changes in key demographic, psychological, diagnostic, and treatment characteristics over 16 years** with the exception of a shift in sex ratio. This may suggest that in the early years, only the tip of the iceberg of the actual number of transgender youth was presented to a transgender clinic and this iceberg has come to surface in recent years. In other words, it seems to be that **the increase in the number of referrals is probably due to the fact that feelings of GD are more common than originally expected, rather than that the threshold to register at a transgender clinic has decreased** in such extent, that a group of other adolescents is seen nowadays. **This finding suggests that a larger group of adolescents who experience GD is able to profit from gender affirming treatment, including puberty suppression.**

**In short:** Despite a 10x increase in patients, the proportion with gender dysphoria was constant, the proportion given gender-affirming hormones was constant, and the proportion given gender-affirming surgery was constant. **This strongly suggests that the gender dysphoria and clinical needs of the new wave of Dutch patients is similar to that of the previous Dutch patients.**

American clinics have also seen a dramatic rise in adolescent patients. Conservatives argue that these patients are brainwashed cis youth who will later regret their transition.

The fact that the Dutch CEGD saw a similar dramatic rise in patients but no decline in proportion of patients needing gender-affirming care suggests that this argument is wrong.

## The USTS Study: Turban et al 2021

### Data source

Turban et al 2021 used data from the 2015 United States Transgender Survey (USTS).[^turban2021note1] The 2015 USTS was a large convenience-snowball sample of 27715 trans people. Respondents were recruited from transgender advocacy organizations (convenience) and encouraged to promote the survey among peers (snowball).

### Results

[^james2016]: James et al 2016: USTS: 8% of trans people have ever detransitioned; of those, 62% reported that they are currently living in a gender different than their birth gender; thus, 3% have permanently or currently detransitioned to their birth gender: <https://transequality.org/sites/default/files/docs/usts/USTS-Full-Report-Dec17.pdf> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/987806275674964028/unknown.png """Respondents were asked whether they had ever “de-transitioned,” which was defined as having “gone back to living as [their] sex assigned at birth, at least for a while.” Eight percent (8%) of respondents reported having de-transitioned at some point. Most of those who de-transitioned did so only temporarily: 62% of those who had de-transitioned reported that they were currently living full time in a gender different than the gender they were thought to be at birth."""


with the following response options: ‘‘Yes,’’ ‘‘No,’’ and ‘‘I have never transitioned.’’

### Generalizability

This is a major limitation of studies using the USTS. Compared to a nationally representative sample of transgender people in the BRFSS, the USTS sample tends to be whiter, younger, less heterosexual, and more educated.

However, high-quality sampling is very difficult when studying trans populations, even harder for detrans populations. A little math exercise: Trans people make up just ~0.5% of the US adult population.[^baker2019] Phone response rates (the proportion of people who pick up and agree to take a phone survey) have dropped from 36% in 1997 to 6% in 2019.[^pew2019] If you wanted a sample of 1000 trans people, you'd need to call (1000 / 0.06) / (0.005) = 3,333,333 random people in the US. Even for surveys with populations that are far easier to reach, the cost per completed interview is about $45[^guterbock2018] -- and now, interviewers would need to waste a few minutes on 99.5% of calls screening out cis people.

Nearly every prominent detransitioner -- Charlie Evans, SaltyAlty, Helena Kirschner -- is also a young white person.
