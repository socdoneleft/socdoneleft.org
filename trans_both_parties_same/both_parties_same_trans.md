# Both parties are not the same on trans issues

This post will highlight the overall differences in state policy on trans issues between Democratic-leaning and Republican-leaning states.

In short: Over a variety of metrics, Democratic states have substantially stronger protections for trans people than Republican states.

This weekend, a Fiscal Times reporter asked neoliberal ghoul Hillary Clinton whether "the transgender debate" harmed the Democrat's electoral chances. Clinton replied that "we are standing on the precipice of losing our democracy" and that a Dem victory is so important that "whatever does not help you win should not be a priority".[^luce2022]

Clinton clearly argues that Democrats should not prioritize transgender issues. In response, a popular tweet asked:

!["""now that hillary clinton has come out very explicitly in opposition to trans liberation will people start to understand what i mean when i, as a trans person, say “both parties are the same”?"""](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/742557921849901077/988980165663154176/unknown.png)

The claim that "both parties are the same" on trans issues is wrong. Whatever you think of her argument, Clinton is a widely-despised political has-been. Both federal and state Democrats support a raft of policies that defend trans rights.

### State policies

The easiest way to compare Dem politicians and Rep politicians on an issue is to look to the states, where legislative majorities are larger and status quo biases are smaller.

The picture is clear on trans rights. Here is a map of the average Democratic presidential 2-party vote share over 2012-2020, taken from [MIT's Election Lab](https://electionlab.mit.edu/data):

Here is a map of 2020 state laws on trans issues, taken from the [LGBT Movement Advancement Project](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps):

The visual match is pretty clear, but it's even clearer in a scatterplot:

In short:

* All states which lean >5% Dem in presidential elections have the strongest protections
* Most states which lean >5% Rep have no such protections (and many of the remainder are under a federal court order requiring them to provide that protection)

We might worry that the policies mentioned above aren't very substantial -- perhaps Dems pass a laws that signal support for trans rights without actually supporting trans rights. The LGBT MAP breaks down their score on gender identity to 22 points. In very brief, states which scored higher tended to:

2. Ban anti-trans discrimination in adoption, employment (including family leave), housing, lending
3. Require private insurance and state Medicaid to cover trans-specific care
4. Ban anti-trans bullying, require queer-inclusive education, and ban conversion therapy
5. Have queer-specific hate crime laws, ban gay/trans panic defense
6. Allow driver's license and birth certificate gender changes, have an easy name change process

These are not just window dressing; they are substantial rights. For an example of the detailed policies, see [California](https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality_maps/profile_state/CA).

### Conclusions

The original tweet didn't just mention trans rights: It mentioned trans liberation. One could argue that trans liberation is a much bigger project than the protections discussed here. And I agree: Like all liberation movements, trans liberation cannot be satisfied under capitalism.

But without these protections, there can be no trans liberation. And without these protections, substantially more trans people would die[^hatzenbuehler2020] from suicide,[^bauer2015] from poverty,[^cumming2021] and from anti-queer violence.[^levy2017]

That's a difference worth protecting. That's why I believe that queer people should vote for socialists and progressives in primary elections and Democrats in general elections.

Call it a survival vote, harm reduction, whatever: A world with weaker Republicans is a world with stronger trans rights.

We predict that pro-equality policies will reduce reported incidence of hate crimes based on sexual orientation, and this seems to be the case with hate crime and employment nondiscrimination laws including sexual orientation. Both policies Granger cause reductions in reported hate crimes, indicative of potential positive externalities. In contrast, we reject H1 e at least in its causal form. Constitutional bans are positively correlated with reported hate crimes, but this relationship is explained by the many controls we include in our model."""

Social support, reduced transphobia, and having any personal identification documents changed to an appropriate sex designation were associated with large relative and absolute reductions in suicide risk, as was completing a medical transition through hormones and/or surgeries (when needed). Parental support for gender identity was associated with reduced ideation. Lower self-reported transphobia (10th versus 90th percentile) was associated with a 66 % reduction in ideation (RR=0.34, 95 % CI: 0.17, 0.67), and an additional 76 % reduction in attempts among those with ideation (RR=0.24; 95 % CI: 0.07, 0.82). This corresponds to potential prevention of 160 ideations per 1000 trans persons, and 200 attempts per 1,000 with ideation, based on a hypothetical reduction of transphobia from current levels to the 10th percentile."""
